# Data-Structures-with-Java

What is Data Structures?
The way to organise data in main memory or ram. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. A data structure is not only used for organizing the data. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data.

What is Algorithm?
Sequence of steps written to solve a problem.

Why DSA?
* Makes you a better Software Developer by making you write time and space efficient codes.
* Helps you in getting a Job, considering current market scenario.
* Winning the sport of Competitive Coding.

Roadmap to learn DSA:

1. Learn a Language:
	* Java
	* C++
	* Python
2. Learn DSA basics and implement. 
3. Learn language libraries that have DSA implemented.
4. Practice and Learn together.

Notes:
* Do not deep dive into learning the language; basic are enough.
* Do not deep dive into learning complex data structure operations; basic operations are enough.
* Do not avoid problem-solving; solve as many problems as possible.
* Do not worry if you are not able to solve a problem; more practice just increases probability of problem-solving.
* Give more interviews.
